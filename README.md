# My first blog on the net

I initiated this weblog on Oct. 2013 back when I was a junior high school student.Mostly I kept posting about football content as it was a hobby of mine.
 Sadly, on 2021 my weblog along hundreds of thousands of others were taken offline, as the host service mihanblog, announced in the same year, that the servers will go offline for good. All we were left with was a XML file.

Updating this weblog as well as initiating it taught me a lot about HTML and was definitely one of my childhood's core memories and a great place to spend time expanding the blog by adding different plugins, exchanging links with other blogers (an old tradition between blogers which helps them grow their audience) writing about my favorite football clubs Real Madrid & Tractor FC and so on.
