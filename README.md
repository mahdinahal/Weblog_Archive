# Weblog
 My first weblog on net

## I initiated this weblog on Oct. 2013 back when I was in elemantry school. I kept posting sport and more specifically football content as it was a hobby of mine.
## Sadly on 2021 hundreds of thousands of blogs including mine were taken offline, as the host service mihan blog, announced in the same year, that the servers will go offline for good. Updating this weblog as well as initating it taought me a lot about HTML and was definitly one of my childhood's core memorys and a great place for to spend time expanding the blog by adding different plugins, exchanging links with other blogers (an old tradition between blogers which helps them grow their audiance) writing about my favourite football clubs Real Madrid & Tractor FC and so on.
